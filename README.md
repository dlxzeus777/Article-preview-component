### Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript

### Difficulties

I had difficulties with positioning the share icons and the whole container on mobile so I created a different solution. Other than that it was pretty fun.

### What I learned

I did a little transition on desktop, when you hover on the whole container it scales up, and I couldn't figure out how to have the opposite transition to make the container what it was before on mouse leave and I found this solution online 'container:not(:hover)'. It's really not much but it looks better in my opinion.
